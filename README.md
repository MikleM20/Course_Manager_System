SENG 300 Lecture 2 Group 15 Group Project.

Iteration 1 (As of March 1, 2019)

The user must have java installed in their system to run the program.
The user may run the program by simply running the executable jar file or by importing the project into an IDE and running it using the IDE, or compiling and running the program with the commandline/terminal.

-The user can login using the default username "admin" with the default Password "Password1".

-If the user does not use proper username and login combination, they will be prompted with a message.

-Once logged in the user can open a faculty, department, programs, and or a courses pages with the 4 buttons on the left side of main menu.

-The user can open one of each window simultaneously(up to 5 windows at once, menu, a faculty, department, programs, and courses page) but the user may not open more than one faculty, department, programs, and courses pages (E.g. user may not open 2 faculty windows at once) the system prevents them from doing so by greying out the orresponding button that is used to open a window.

-Inside the faculty, department, programs, and courses windows the user can interact with a touchdown containing a list of dummy objects that are placeholders of the faculties, departments, programs, and courses. Which will be added later on.

-At the bottom of these windows the is a search section which currently does not do anything and will be implemented later on. 

-The user may also log out, if the user presses logout with any of the faculty, department, programs, and courses windows open, those windows will automatically close and the user will be logged out, requiring the username and password once again if the user wishes to navigate to the main menu once again.

-The "Settings" and add button on the main menu do not do anything and will be implemented later on.
